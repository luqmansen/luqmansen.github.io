I have written this post on my note since 23 May 2020, but just got free time to actually post this up until now. Since it's almost a year since this supposed to be posted, soon I'll make part 2.

Actually, one of the reasons why I want to start blogging again is because my training partner at my workplace (yes, I'm working right now, I'll make new post later). So I read her [blog](https://rulisastra.medium.com/) and this is the same thing I've always tought when I write something, 

>I canâ€™t control or satisfied them all. So instead of worrying, I decided to write anything anywhere in hope that I can leave my tracks in this life before they were long forgotten.


This words is kinda motivate me again, soooo yeah, here I am. After this sentence is the actual post that I wrote back in May 2020, enjoy!

I think I want to write this format at least once a year, might twice idk. So, this is like what the title said, I want recap what I've done, or to be specific, achieved, for last year. 

But for this first time, instead I wanna to recap from the beginning of my journey as a student up until now. Some of this is, I actually really wanted to create its own post even though the event already way in the past, but whatever, I'll do it someday. Anyway, let's start

- I got my first "real" internship and
- How to do things on the production
-  For the first time, I participated in hackathons
-  I got my first scholarship (post coming soon)
-  I joined DTS scholarship season 2 (post coming soon)
-  My project ambis have actually started and now moving toward microservices post coming soon)
-  I learned JAVASCRIPT OMG CAN'T BELIEVED THIS and all npm stuff, and
-  I wrote my first time ever game ALSO ON JS and 
-  I also learn Node js, ofc (all Js stuff post coming soon)
-  I got more advanced on setup CI/CD, continued from part 1 (post coming soon)
-  I migrated fully to linux
-  I migrate my blog to Jekyll
-  what else?


That's what I can think now. If I remember other things inside this timeline, I might update this list. A lot from that list deserved its own post, so until next time. See yaa
