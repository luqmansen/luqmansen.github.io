We cannot return anything from inside that method just like a normal method did. However, we can pass that value once it's done the process. How we did this ? Using our holy callback. Honestly, after following many of tutorial i just get the understanding one of the function of an interface and callback stuff.\nSo, the one of the option of passing the string value is through this callback, then, I need a interface.<script src=\""],["https://gist.github.com/luqmansen/8c3c398baa9117bbd04280c971d775da.js\"></script>",[["a","https://gist.github.com/luqmansen/8c3c398baa9117bbd04280c971d775da.js%22%3E%3C/script%3E"]]],["\nThis interface are the method that whoever wants to get the value from my callback, have to implement this interface.
