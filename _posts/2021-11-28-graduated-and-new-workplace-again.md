Last time, my post was my rant about how dumpster fire my life was for the past few months,  how fucked up my bachelor thesis is going, and even more because I am working (quite) full time at my new workplace. In mid of July, my trainee period had finished and I got an offer as a full-timer there, but  I decided not to continue my job there instead start working on my bachelor thesis full time, something that I should have been doing XD. Long story short, I defended my bachelor thesis on 24 September 2021 and unofficially (until graduation ceremony) obtain my engineering degree yeayy ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

In the weeks leading up to my thesis defense, I had been preparing for technical interviews, specifically brushing up on my data structures and algorithms skills. I also casually applied to a few job openings that seemed interesting, but weren't my top priority. Some of the hiring processes went smoothly and, the day before my thesis seminar, I received an offer from Loket as a software engineer, which I accepted. I also got another offer, but I turned it down due to a few things that made me uncomfortable.

It's been almost two months since I started working at Loket and, so far, I'm happy with my decision. There's still room for improvement, though. One thing I don't like is that I have to work with Ruby and some of its syntax still drives me crazy. However, I was hired to break down the legacy and monolithic Ruby code into smaller Go services, so that's something to look forward to.

Looking back, do I regret taking the job at my previous workplace and not finishing my bachelor's thesis earlier, resulting in having to pay for a 9th semester of tuition? Honestly, I still say yes, I regret it. I could have finished my degree earlier and had more time to prepare for job interviews, but on the bright side, the experience I gained at my previous job was really valuable. The engineering practices were top-notch, the product was cool, the team was amazing, and my role there played a major role in getting me to my current company.

Well, that's all for now. Thanks for reading!
