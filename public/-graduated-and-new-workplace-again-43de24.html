In mid of July, my trainee period had finished and I got an offer as a full-timer there, but I decided not to continue my job there and instead start working on my bachelor thesis full time, something that I should have been doing XD. Long story short, I defended my bachelor&#x27;s thesis on 24 September 2021 and unofficially (until graduation ceremony) obtain my engineering degree yeayy ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/db534fde1ff54b98a754a08dd78a6fcf" class="Image Image--Normal"><figure><a href="https://www.notion.so/signed/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F5ad16e96-79c7-439b-b238-60b1c305bdc8%2FAfter_Thesis_Defense.jpeg?width=288&amp;table=block&amp;id=db534fde-1ff5-4b98-a754-a08dd78a6fcf"><img src="https://www.notion.so/signed/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F5ad16e96-79c7-439b-b238-60b1c305bdc8%2FAfter_Thesis_Defense.jpeg?width=288&amp;table=block&amp;id=db534fde-1ff5-4b98-a754-a08dd78a6fcf" style="width:288px"/></a><figcaption><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">After thesis defense</span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/67294aa211cd4cbf8b3e86728220a4b5" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/1b5bbfe0593843578a1a0661a308f9ec" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">In the weeks leading up to my thesis defense, I had been preparing for technical interviews, specifically brushing up on my data structures and algorithms skills. I also casually applied to a few job openings that seemed interesting but weren‚Äôt my top priority. Some of the hiring processes went smoothly and, the day before my thesis seminar, I received an offer from Loket as a software engineer, which I accepted. I also got another offer, but I turned it down due to a few things that made me uncomfortable.</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/d95cde54959f48f19d898f16fd60b7e7" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">It‚Äôs been almost two months since I started working at Loket and, so far, I‚Äôm happy with my decision. There‚Äôs still room for improvement, though. One thing I don‚Äôt like is that I have to work with Ruby and some of its syntaxes still drive me crazy. However, I was hired to break down the legacy and monolithic Ruby code into smaller Go services, so that‚Äôs something to look forward to.</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/f52c3b84f2e749f9a1a8f111714df6b9" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Looking back, do I regret taking the job at my previous workplace and not finishing my bachelor‚Äôs thesis earlier, resulting in having to pay for a 9th semester of tuition? Honestly, I still say ‚Äúyes I regret it‚Äù. I could have finished my degree earlier and had more time to prepare for job interviews, but on the bright side, the experience I gained at my previous job was really valuable. The engineering practices were top-notch, the product was cool, the team was amazing, and my role there played a major role in getting me to my current company.</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/1bc6dc2cf769474d8f6a0bbf8e688441" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Well, that‚Äôs all for now.
