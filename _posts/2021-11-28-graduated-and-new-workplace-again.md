Last time, my post was my rant about how dumpster fire my life was for the past few months,  how fucked up my bachelor thesis is going, and even more because I am working (quite) full time at my new workplace. In mid of July, my trainee period had finished and I got an offer as a full-timer there, but  I decided not to continue my job there instead start working on my bachelor thesis full time, something that I should have been doing ðŸ¤£. Long story short, I defended my bachelor thesis on 24 September 2021 and unofficially (until graduation ceremony) obtain my engineering degree yeayy ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

Before the D-Day, I was actually already preparing for a technical interview, especially my data structure and algorithm skills for the past few weeks before my thesis seminar days. For approximately 2 weeks Iâ€™ve been applying casually for any *interesting-but-not-really-my-priority* vacancy. And yeah, some of the hiring processes actually go very smooth until the final interview. D-1 before my thesis seminar, I got an offer at [Loket](https://loket.com/) as a software engineer which I then accept the offer. I also got another offer but I rejected it because of one or two things that made me uncomfortable. 

Sooooâ€¦ yeah, that's pretty much it. Now, Itâ€™s been almost two months since I worked here, and so far Iâ€™m still comfortable working here. There is a lot of room to improve things here. Things that I still donâ€™t like are that I have to work with ruby and I still really hate some of the absurdity of rubyâ€™s syntax. No, the ruby is legacy and monolith code, I was (probably) hired to break them down into smaller services on Go.

Some reflection about my decision: do I regret that I took the job at my previous workplace and it turns out it doesnâ€™t really fit with me and makes me not finish my bachelor thesis earlier so that I have to pay for 9th-semester tuition? To be honest Iâ€™ll still answer this with Yes, I regret it. I could have finished my degree earlier, and have had more time preparing for my job interview, but looking at the brighter side, actually, itâ€™s not that bad. The experience I got there was REALLY awesome! The engineering practice is really great, the product is actually really cool, the team was amazing, and because of my role there, I think it is one of the main contributions for me to get to my current company.

Aight then, thatâ€™s all for now, thanks for reading.
