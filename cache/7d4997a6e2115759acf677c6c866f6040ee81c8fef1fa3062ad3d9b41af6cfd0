So, what do I want to talk about? Well, since the semester break is almost here, that means it's time for me to start looking for an internship, right? Not necessarily. In my department, it's traditionally expected for students to start looking for internships during the 5th-semester break. Aside from following this tradition, it also makes the most sense to take an internship during this time.\n\n*Note: I wrote this chronologically and more like a story, so I hope you can enjoy it.\n\nIn my department, it's called a \"working practice\" (is that even the correct term?). What sets it apart from a normal internship is that my department requires a minimum of 1 month of internship. This can be challenging because many companies now require interns to work for at least 3 months. Because my department only allows me to skip class for 1 month, I have to ask for permission to skip class for the additional 2 months. This isn't a major issue since most semester breaks at my university last 1-2 months.\n\nOkay, let's begin my (yet another) journey of looking for an internship. I started my search in September and became more proactive in sending out my resume in November and December. I made a note of all the companies I applied to for tracking purposes."]]},{"children":[],"uri":"https://www.notion.so/fa980a9674ff4cf687895c04cce26001","type":"image","createdTime":1672849200000,"lastEditedTime":1672849200000,"source":"https://www.notion.so/signed/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F13eff4da-a374-4020-abee-ce8f97c5d529%2FUntitled.png?width=520&table=block&id=fa980a96-74ff-4cf6-8789-5c04cce26001","caption":[["There is still a lot more"]],"width":520,"height":563,"fullWidth":false,"pageWidth":false,"aspectRatio":1.0826923076923076,"preserveScale":true},{"children":[],"uri":"https://www.notion.so/9fc776739c3a44b7a561bf4c1c60b07e","type":"text","createdTime":1672849200000,"lastEditedTime":1672849200000,"title":[["In total, I applied to 28 companies, 15 of which never responded, 6 of which rejected me, and 3 of which accepted me.
