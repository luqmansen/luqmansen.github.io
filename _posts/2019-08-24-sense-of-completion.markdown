So when you read a book, i would be broken down into lot of chapter, right? Other than making it more modular about each chapter, it also make you have this sense of completion after finishing a chapter. The feeling when you finished the assignment for that chapter after struggling understanding that, rather than making it one big chunk of text.

I recently taking a lot of golang courses and the instructor mention about this. The course was designed to be broken into many modules and each modules has some kind of project to finish. That's really cool to make our brain keep stimulated, rather than make the big final project, broken it down into some part. This is how you should design something involved with people. Stimulate their sense of accomplishment to make them keep curious what next. You can also combine it with some &nbsp;gamification. I know some e-commerce &nbsp;in Indonesia used this. They kinda make some points after a purchase and stuff, it's kinda cool
