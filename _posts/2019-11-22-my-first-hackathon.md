Hello, long time no see ! It's been a quite a while since last time write a post to this blog. I've been very busy with college stuff, lab report, internship, and yeah, at the peak of all that, I decided to quit for a while (and add more stress  ._.) to join my first ever hackathon, wohoooo

It started in the middle of september, my friend ask me to star a team and join a hackathon competition, well as a yes man, I agreed immediately. Then, after submitting abstract, then (unsurprisingly) we going to next phase, which submitting a hackathon proposal. This process while not that hard, but for me who not kind of people that like to write formal (quite scientifically) writing, but i have to do that. Then long story short, at 10 November, the announcement come, and we managed to be 1 of 10 finalist, wohooo, we go to Bandung!

We have 5 days left for preparation, but but fortunately, we've (somehow) very sure that we're going to final, so we already prepared week before for all technical stuff, ofc without any code in it. I feel relieved because i have a senior who already have experience in hackathon, so what he suggest is

1. Create a job list for each task
2. Specify what to do in each taks
3. Make sure each task is broken down into very pieces
4. Use management tools, like trello or any kanban style project management

Then, after week of preparation (not really, probably we just have meeting twice :P). Its D-2 or 15 November, we head to Bandung using a train. Our train was 6 AM, so we head to train station around 5.15AM, just to make sure we didn't late.

 It's 8 hr trip and would be a very good time to discuss for our preparation right ? Yeah it supposedly,but then i realized that i actuallly bought a train ticked next to my friend, except I'am on a diffrent train cab.

Okay that's fine, i spend my time tried to read REST api project on internet, while trying to make planning for my own api. Then, 8 hours later, finally i stepped out to Stasiun Bandung, yay !

Then we immediately head to our small hotel (more precisly lodge), and get a rest for a while,

Later that night, we finish more asset for tomorrow, since everything is prohibited but graphic asset. And my other friends tried some library to be used tomorrow. Me ? It's just 10 PM, lemme just sleep (lol).

Our hackathon took place in BTP Coworking Space. This is beyond my expectation, almost every team got it's own room, rather than an open space for everyone (just few team placed outside room, but still cozy place)

I finished my first REST backend in 2 hours for the basic functionality, the rest of the team is doing the application, which took most of our time (java null pointer error everywhere). 

Long story short, we manage (to stay alive) on next day. We got our uggly yellow t-shirt and prepare for the presentation

Annnd, finally what we are waiting for, the announcement for the winner. We didn't finish as we expected (sad). Well, even that, this is our first experience in hackathon and i'm learn a lot from this. Maybe next time, then.
