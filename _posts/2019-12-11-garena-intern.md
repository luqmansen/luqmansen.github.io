Hellooow, I'm back after lab report has taken my life a lot this semester. So, what I want to talk about? Well, since semester break is almost there, that means for me to start looking for a internship, right ? Not really tho, but normally, in my Department, student start looking for an intern at 5th-semester break. Other than following the tradition, also this is the most make sense period for taking an internship.

*Note: I wrote this in chronological way and more like writing a story and not a straight forward, so yeah, I hope you can enjoy it.

Well, in my Department, formally it's called working practice (is that even correct ?), you know what I mean. What makes it differ from normal intern, is, it's actually just a normal internship, but my Department give a minimum time, at least 1 month of internship period to be passed. 

What makes it (kinda) hard is, now most of company put minimal amount of intern is around 3 month, so ? Well, because my Department only gave me 1-month permission for skipping class, for the rest of 2 month, I should work for the permission myself (permission to skip the class). That's because most of semester break on my university is around 1 - 2 months. But but, that's actually not a big problem tho

Okay, let's start my (another) journey of looking for internship. Okay, I start my first aggression (lol) around September, and I get more intensive to send my resume around November-December. I make a note for tracking to all company where I applied.

In total, I sent around **28 application, 15 being ghosted, 6 of them rejected, and 3 of them is accepted**. Hyuh~ (the other two that got accepted was told after I got accepted on Garena, so that's for another story)

From 6 rejected application, almost all of them are at last stage of selection, and that's kinda hurt me. Yea after investing quite a lot of time for interview, test, creating application, and well yeah, that how life works. That's actually make me realize how much do I need to learn. I got time to actually re-evaluate myself after all of the rejection.

### 1 December 2019

Okay cool, back to Garena, I applied 1 December 2019, after scrolling through 10.000++ message on telegram, i found this gem, hiding inside an album on telegram. Fortunately, the album was named 'Internship'

But after looking at the preferred knowledge, which the tech-stack is around python environment, such as Django, Dlask, but it also mention about having an experience in creating backend for mobile app, well I'm. So just think about everything later and I give it a shot.

### 5 December 2019

I got a call from the recruiter, get an invitation for the interview, but at that time, It was so hectic with lab activity and stuff. So, I ask for schedule the interview for next week, she agreed, and set the interview at 9 December, which is next Monday. Okay cool

### 9 December 2019

Interview day, and also my first day for final term exam. The interview was scheduled for 2 PM till 3 PM over skype. Okay everything normal. But I encounter some problem with my skype camera, not a big deal. We start the interview. First he only asked me about my backend experience and stuff, not so much. it's probably only 5 minutes, then the test started. He sent me an file problem, I should finished in within 45 minutes. Well, I never expected to do live coding on paper here. He also asked me to point my camera to the paper where I work. Okay fine, I start to doing the solution. It's not that hard actually, but since I had nothing to test my code, then you should just imaging you're debugging over your code on the paper. The SQL problem is actually an easy one tho. 

Okay then, I'm done in around 37 minutes, and not guarantee that everything that I wrote going to compile or anything, and also some of the problem isn't done in the most efficient way, but yeah fk it. 

### 10 December 2019

It's afternoon, around 12AM I just get into my room and I left my phone on the bed. Right after I open the door, suddenly I got a call, and it's from Greater Area Jakarta. surprise surprise. I passed the test and I was asked when it is possible for me to start the Intern. Oh sh**, that was unexpected, okay calm down. After some negotiation, I agreed that I'll start the intern at 20 December and It'll end in 20 March 2020. Cool, now I have to back to focus on my last semester Exam which end in like 18 Dec or Wednesday, so I only have 1 day to prepare for my departure to Jakarta.

### 19 December 2019

This is the day when I going to depart from my hometown in Magelang. I going to Jakarta by train from Tugu Station, Jogjakarta. On the same day, I arrived at Jatinegara Station. Cool.
