This is the second part of my (self) appreciation post, as to how far I've been progressing, and I think, I also wanted to share how's I'm doing.

So I tried to memorize how things going from my timeline. This will start from the last time I should have to post my first appreciation [post](https://luqmansen.github.io/how-far-you-have-come/). Here we go


- I extend my internship until almost a year (Dec 2020 - Nov 2021), because of that
- I've been financially independent since then
- I got my second scholarship (2020)
- For the second time, me and my uni robotics team going to the national level (2020)
- For the first time, being a [Gemastik](https://gemastik13.telkomuniversity.ac.id/)'s Finalist (2020)
- I signed up for a community service program (2020-2021)
- I actually working my microservice project, which previously was [project ambis](https://luqmansen.github.io/project-ambis-started/) until it became (an abandoned) [project hanako](https://github.com/luqmansen/hanako/) until now I working on [Gosty](https://github.com/luqmansen/gosty/) as my final thesis (Present)
- I got a job (still being a trainee actually) as a Backend Golang engineer, something that I used to (and still) wanted to be, wohooo (Present)
