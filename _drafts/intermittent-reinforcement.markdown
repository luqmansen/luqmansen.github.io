This is the same feeling when you play slot machine, you failed many times, but after you keep trying, then eventually you succeed once. This is what i also felt when my program failed to compile many times, but after hours of struggling and stackoverflow pages, i finally managed to make it work.

That's what make our brain &nbsp;stimulated to keep doing it again and again. Let's think about this, if you stuck for few days (or maybe month) on some problem. Because our brain needs that feeling of accomplishment, whether you going quit or keep trying it (also depending on your mental strength , lol). &nbsp;

Enough of this random stuff, have a nice day
